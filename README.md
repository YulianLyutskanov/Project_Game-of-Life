# Project_Game-of-Life
Course project Game of Life, created by me for my UP Practicum course @ FMI, Sofia University.
Overview
This C++ console application implements Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. 
The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans. 
The game follows simple rules, making it an interesting and visually appealing simulation.

# Features
Console-based Interface: The game is designed to be played in a console environment, providing a straightforward and lightweight user experience.

Customizable Grid Size: Users can define the size of the grid, allowing for different configurations and patterns.

Random Initialization: The initial state of the grid can be randomly generated, providing variety and unpredictability in each simulation.

Interactive Mode: Users have the option to interactively toggle cell states, creating their own patterns during runtime.
